The chatbot would provide a personalized conversational experience for a large number of patients, offering guidance and information related to various medical conditions. You explored different approaches and finalized the idea of using prompt engineering techniques along with the GPT-4 API to develop the chatbot. This combination would leverage the power of advanced language models and allow for dynamic and context-aware interactions with patients. The goal was to enhance patient care and improve accessibility to medical information through the use of state-of-the-art AI technology."
